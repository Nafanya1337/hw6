\nI want to break free, I want to break free\n
I want to break free from your lies\n
You\'re so self-satisfied I don\'t need you\n
I\'ve got to break free\n
God knows, God knows I want to break free\n
I\'ve fallen in love\n
I\'ve fallen in love for the first time\n
This time I know it\'s for real\n
I\'ve fallen in love, yeah\n
God knows, God knows I\'ve fallen in love\n
It\'s strange but it\'s true, hey\n
I can\'t get over the way you love me like you do\n
But I have to be sure when I walk out that door\n
Oh, I want to be free, baby\n
Oh, how I want to be free\n
Oh, I want to break free</string>

\nBack in black\n
I hit the sack\n
I\'ve been too long, I\'m glad to be back\n
Yes, I\'m let loose\n
From the noose\n
That\'s kept me hanging about\n
I\'ve been looking at the sky\n
\'Cause it\'s gettin\' me high\n
Forget the hearse \'cause I never die\n
I got nine lives\n
Cat\'s eyes\n
Abusin\' every one of them and running wild\n
\'Cause I\'m back\n
Yes, I\'m back\n
Well, I\'m back\n
Yes, I\'m back\n
Well, I\'m back, back\n
Well, I\'m back in black\n
Yes, I\'m back in black\n
Back in the back\n
Of a Cadillac\n
Number one with a bullet, I\'m a power pack\n
Yes, I\'m in a bang\n
With a gang\n
They\'ve got to catch me if they want me to hang\n
\'Cause I\'m back on the track\n
And I\'m beatin\' the flack\n
Nobody\'s gonna get me on another rap\n
So look at me now\n
I\'m just makin\' my play\n
Don\'t try to push your luck, just get out of my way\n
\'Cause I\'m back\n
Yes, I\'m back\n
Well, I\'m back\n
Yes, I\'m back\n
Well, I\'m back, back\n
Well, I\'m back in black\n
Yes, I\'m back in black\n
Well, I\'m back, yes, I\'m back\n
Well, I\'m back, yes, I\'m back\n
Well, I\'m back, back\n
Well, I\'m back in black\n
Yes, I\'m back in black\n
Oh, yeah\n
Oh, yeah\n
Take my love\n
Oh, yeah, yeah\n
Oh, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah\n
Well, I\'m back (I\'m back)\n
Back (I\'m back)\n
Back (I\'m back)\n
Back (I\'m back)\n
Back (I\'m back)\n
Back\n
Back in black\n
Yes, I\'m back in black\n
I\'ve hit the sack</string>
